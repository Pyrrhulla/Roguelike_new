# Roguelike (Godot)

A classic 8 bit roguelike with randomly generated levels (dungeons), made in Godot. A little game-sample about a little ork, escaping an elven underground prison.
At this moment the game contains: 
- A standard dungeon-like locations and a boss level
- Inventory
- Two weapons  
- Several kinds of enimies
